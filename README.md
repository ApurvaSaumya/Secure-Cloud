# Secure-Cloud
This system is a secure infrastructure for the users, which will enable them to store and share highly-sensitive and confidential data in a very secure manner. The developed system enables the users to upload and exchange data in the form of files, which may include personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive details. Such information must not be acquired by any unauthorized third-party as it may lead to serious misuse. This system ensures total safety of the user data. 

Firstly, it prevents any information disclosure attack by third-parties, hackers and other outsiders, by means of signup verification (Secure Device Issuance) and cloud data encryption. Then, it also prevents any possible attack by insiders, who have direct access to the database, and may specifically target a particular user or type of information. Insider attack is prevented by not revealing any information which can identify the file as well as not requiring any passwords for file access. The file names as well as contents are never revealed to any insider or hacker using the concept of tokenization, which ensures dynamic privacy of the user data in the system. Zero knowledge protocol based authentication is used for granting file access. Thus, the system is a complete framework for handling the privacy of user data stored in the cloud.
